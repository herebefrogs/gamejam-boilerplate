scratchpad:
- lots of x,y also have a corresponding w,h. That could be captured in a rect(x,y,w,h) structure
  - ala https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect
  - with some convenience methods for x1,y1 in rect? and rect1 intersect with rect?


- add CCapture.js for recording in-progress movies during development

game engine
===========
- text rendering shouldn't go on an overlay by default  
- improved inputs
  - keyboard: double key press
  - pointer: double click
    - classic D-PAD behaviour (need a name for my current implementation)
    - classic D-PAD rendering (ala Remi overlay circle/range with smaller overlay circle/pad)
  - gamepad
- lerp-smoothing?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?
- ECS
  - rectangle class for bounding box and quick AABB collision logic
    - useful for camera window & player, camera window & off screen entities
  - System base class
  - Component base class
    - inputs
    - velocity
    - position
    - shape
      - display list/nested shape/skeleton animation
  - Entity base class
  - UI widgets for game menus

build chain
===========
custom:
- replace all const by var before JS gets inlined in HTML
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
libs:
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip?
  - Mac build https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool/releases/download/v0.8.3/ect-0.8.3-macOS.zip (need manual install & permission shenanigans)
  - npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ect-bin (but didn't seem to be available in command line afterwards... postinstall failed?)
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)
