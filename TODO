- add CCapture.js for recording in-progress movies during development

game engine
===========
- lerp-smoothing?
- gamepad support?
- tinyfont.js? https://github.com/darkwebdev/tinyfont.js
- support multiple voices for speech synthesis?

build chain
===========
custom:
- replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
libs:
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip?
  - Mac build https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool/releases/download/v0.8.3/ect-0.8.3-macOS.zip (need manual install & permission shenanigans)
  - npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ect-bin (but didn't seem to be available in command line afterwards... postinstall failed?)
- avif in place of png/webp (not enough browser support yet)
